## Function list

|  # | Function | FP type | Complexity | Weight (IFPUG) | Count | FP contribution |
| -: | - | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| 1 | Create customer contact (type, date, topic, names, optional docs, remarks) | EI | Medium | 4 | 1 | 4 |
| 2 | Edit contact data | EI | Medium | 4 | 1 | 4 |
| 3 | Contact data database | ILF | Low | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| 4 | Customer data database | ILF | Low | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| 5 | Document references | EIF | Low | 5 | 1 | 5 |
| 6 | Display customer contacts | EQ | High | 6 | 1 | 6 |
| 7 | Report: revenue per customer (yearly) | EO | High | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| 8 | Report: total revenue per year (aggregated) | EO | High | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| 9 | Report: customers interest prediction | EO | High | 7 | 1 | 7 |
| 10 | Report: customers without contact in x months | EO | High | 7 | 1 | 7 |
|   | **Sum** |   |   |   |   | **61** |

## Influence of requirements

- 6 with strong influence
- 2 with medium influence
- 2 with low influence
- 4 no influence


| Influence | Weight | Count | Contribution |
| - | -: | -: | -: |
| Strong | 5 | 6 | 30 |
| Medium | 3 | 2 | 6 |
| Low | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| None | 0 | 4 | 0 |
| **Sum** |   |   | **38** |

## Value adjustment factor



$\text{Value Adjustment Factor} = (\text{Sum of influence contributions} * 0.01) + 0.65$

$\text{VAF} = (38 * 0.01) + 0.65 = 1.03$

## Adjusted Function Points

$\text{FP} = \text{Unadjusted FP} * \text{VAF}$
$\text{FP} = 61 * 1.03 = 62.83 \approx 63$

## Effort in person-months

10 FP = 10-15 PM

Lower estimate:
$63\text{ FP} * \frac{10\text{ PM}}{10\text{ FP}} = 63\text{ PM}$

Upper estimate:
$63\text{ FP} * \frac{15\text{ PM}}{10\text{ FP}}\approx 94\text{ PM}$

## Cost estimation

Assuming that 1 FP = 1020€

63 FP * 1020€ = 64260€



# b) FP / PM relationship

x axis: Function Points (FP)
y axis: Person Months (PM)

FP and PM have a linearly proportional relationship.
As FP increase, PM also increase by 1x to 1.5x.
The spread (1.0–1.5 PM per FP) visualizes uncertainty in productivity and complexity.


## When is FP to PM conversion useful?

- Early in the project, when detailed task breakdowns are not yet available.
- When organization / company has data on past projects to calibrate FP to PM conversion.
- When comparing productivity across teams, technologies and projects.

..and when not?

- When there are many non-functional requirements (UX design, research, prototyping).
- When productivity varies strongly between teams or technologies
- With very large teams, in which communication can be hard and time consuming.
